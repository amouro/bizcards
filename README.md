bizcards
========

business cards using HTML + CSS + JavaScript + chromium + printer

I wanted to make some quick-and-dirty busines cards using Google Docs
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1td2C-LrQ6pQnNI6tPKDCQrCfRUh7IarOvHzFkHHpJwk/edit

That got annoying and I didn't succeed, so I tried plain old HTML

Printing works on Ubuntu with Chromium on the Taipei Hackerspace HP Photosmart C6300
I haven't tried other browsers or printers
